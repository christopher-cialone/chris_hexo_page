				<h2>Nice to meet you, I'm John Doe</h2>
				<h4>A web designer living in Toronto, Canada</h4>
				<p>Hello World! My name is Christopher Cialone and  I am a Full-Stack Web Developer. I am currently acquiring additional programming skills with Justice Through Code at Columbia Business School. As a developer and consultant, I am interacting with companies and consumers identifying problems while onboarding and educating users on the appropriate software solutions. 
				</p>
				<p> I am passionate about incorporating NFC technology and leveraging the immutability of blockchain to give more clarity and transparency to everyday processes instantaneously. Outside of programming I enjoy competitive sports, learning new topics, coffee and I still make time to read The Count of Monte Cristo and The Three Musketeers at least once a year.
